# 1_Introduction
## 1_1_What is this?
**Taxi Demand Predictor** is the Final Project I have developed as part of my Master in Data Science - KSCHOOL (2019-2020).

It is a machine learning app that predicts for the next three days how many passengers will request a taxi in Manhattan (New York). Predictions are made by city zone and in hourly periods.

**If you are a KSCHOOL teacher or just want to read the whole ProjectÂ´s documentation go straight to the wiki page.**

## 1_2_Why?
If a taxi driver could know in advance (and with precission) which boroughs or areas are going to have the biggest demand, he could optimize his workday by driving only around those areas. He could choose whether to earn more money in the same time or save that time for his family/personal life. Either way, it will improve his life.

## 1_3_Why is relevant?
There has been a lot of debate and riots in the past year regarding how Uber is literally eating the traditional street hail taxi market. Taxi drivers are afraid that they cannot compete with the kind of on-demand fare-adjusted service Uber provide, based in cutting-edge technology.

I think that traditional taxi drivers should also make use of advance technology like this machine learning app in order to improve their service and profitability.
